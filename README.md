### Description 
BookLibrary is application which provides basic information about books.

I used **Spring Boot** to build REST Api,this framework is also responsible for error handling for my Api.
For test i used.

Tools such as **Postman** and **RestAssured** helped me perform test on my api.

Most commonly used design pattern in this app is dependency incjection,i used it to inject BookService into api controller.
